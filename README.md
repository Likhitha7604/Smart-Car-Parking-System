# Smart-Car-Parking-System
In commercial areas there are no open parking spaces available and finding an empty parking space a􀅌er entering a large parking lot are the two major issues which are addressed.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Finding a parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during the rush hours, is difficult for drivers. Difficulty arises from not knowing where the available spaces, may be at that time traffic congestion may occur. Traditional parking systems often lack real-time data and intelligent management capabilities, resulting in inefficient utilization of parking resources. Even the drivers get frustrated due to this which is leading to time-consuming searches for parking spots. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of innovative IoT-enabled car parking systems to revolutionize urban mobility.

MOTIVATION:

With growing urbanization and increasing vehicle ownership, traditional parking systems are   becoming inefficient, leading to congestion, wasted time, and frustrated drivers. By leveraging Arduino and IoT technologies, we aim to revolutionize parking management, optimize space utilization, reduce congestion, and enhance user experience. This system seeks to offer a solution that not only addresses current parking challenges but also prepares cities for future mobility needs in a sustainable and efficient manner. And thus, the title “Smart Car Parking System.” This project really sounded interesting because of the development of this system using IoT technology and it is motivated by a shared vision of a future where cities are vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable and to have an organised cities which are environmentally responsible.
