# Smart-Car-Parking-System
In commercial areas there are no open parking spaces available and finding an empty parking space aô€…Œer entering a large parking lot are the two major issues which are addressed.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Finding a parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during the rush hours, is difficult for drivers. Difficulty arises from not knowing where the available spaces, may be at that time traffic congestion may occur. Traditional parking systems often lack real-time data and intelligent management capabilities, resulting in inefficient utilization of parking resources. Even the drivers get frustrated due to this which is leading to time-consuming searches for parking spots. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of innovative IoT-enabled car parking systems to revolutionize urban mobility.
